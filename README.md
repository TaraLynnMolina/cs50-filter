# cs50-filter
A C program that applies image filters such as grayscale, sepia, reflect, and blur to bitmap (.bmp) images. Built as part of CS50x (Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University).

ðŸ“– Overview

The program takes a bitmap image as input and applies one of several filters. The implementation manipulates pixel data directly to achieve the effects.

Available filters:
	â€¢	Grayscale â€“ converts the image to shades of gray
	â€¢	Sepia â€“ gives the image a warm, brownish tint
	â€¢	Reflect â€“ flips the image horizontally
	â€¢	Blur â€“ applies a box blur to soften the image

Example:
./filter -g infile.bmp outfile.bmp   # grayscale
./filter -s infile.bmp outfile.bmp   # sepia
./filter -r infile.bmp outfile.bmp   # reflect
./filter -b infile.bmp outfile.bmp   # blur

ðŸ›  Features
	â€¢	Direct manipulation of bitmap image pixels.
	â€¢	Implements four classic filters.
	â€¢	Input/output using .bmp files.
  
ðŸš€ How to Run
	1.	Compile the program: make filter
  2.	Run the program with the desired filter flag (-g, -s, -r, -b):
  ./filter [flag] infile.bmp outfile.bmp
  3.	View the resulting output image in any image viewer.
